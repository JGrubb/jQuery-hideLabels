##jQuery HideLabels

I got tired of writing the code to hide and show form labels that were nested inside of form inputs on tightly spaced forms.  So after about the 4th time, I wrote my first jQuery plugin to do it for me.

###Usage

Currently only takes the selector of the label you want to hide --

`$('label.overlay').hideLabels();`
